##### 1. Introduction to NumPy – Overview of NumPy arrays vs Python lists.

Array Creation – np.zeros, np.ones, np.arange, np.linspace.

Array Attributes – Exploring shape, dimensions, item size, and data types.

Reshaping & Indexing – Transforming arrays with .reshape() and accessing elements.

Broadcasting – Demonstrating element-wise operations without loops.

Mathematical Functions – Applying trigonometric and logarithmic functions.

Linear Algebra – Dot product, QR decomposition, SVD, and matrix operations.

Random Numbers – Using np.random for generating synthetic data.

Vectorization – Comparing loop-based vs vectorized computations.
